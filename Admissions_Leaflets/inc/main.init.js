This course is taught by the students Adviser. The Grade 10 Adviser program is combined with the Careers course, which is a compulsory diploma requirement for all Ontario students. The content of this course enables Advisers to work with students on thinking about opportunities beyond high school. Throughout Grade 9 and 10, students continue to work with their Adviser to identify areas of strength and how they can use these strengths to support their learning. Grades 11 and 12In Grade 11, students have the option to enrol in an Adviser course which is scheduled into their timetable. Through this course, they earn a Learning Strategies credit. In Grade 12, students and Advisers meet individually outside of the timetable or in a scheduled, non-credit transition class which helps students consolidate their study skills.Advisers guide students through postsecondary decision-making, the application process and the transition to life beyond Greenwood by helping students refine skills and attributes such as communication, collaboration, critical and creative thinking, self-regulation and digital literacy.

The Enrollment Management Association (EMA), based in Princeton, New Jersey, has developed the Character Skills Snapshot which is an online, 20-30 minute tool that examines seven essential character qualities or non-cognitive attributes of individual students, which research has shown are most prevalent among independent school missions and which those schools seek to nurture in their students.Students who apply to Greenwood for admission need not take the Secondary SchoolREAD MORE ABOUT CHARACTER Admission Test (SSAT), but are required toASSESSMENT AND THE CSS:complete the Character Skills Snapshot (CSS) Are SSATs and GPA Enough?
