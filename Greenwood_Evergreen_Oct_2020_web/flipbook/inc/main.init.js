I certainly did not anticipate one of those challengesto be contending with a global pandemic.I have been looking for a phrase to sum up the complexities posed by the pandemic, and I recently found one: what we are facing in COVID\\x7f19 is a wicked problem. A wicked problem is a social or cultural problem that is incredibly diicult to tackle. These problems have many facets, and most of them are interconnected, meaning you cannot change one without aecting another.A wicked problem such as COVID\\x7f19 could easily have paralyzed usbut that is not what I have seen from the Greenwood community over the last several months. Students, sta, parents and alumni have demonstrated not only resilience, optimism and compassion, but innovation. A great example is the Alumni Instagram Live Series hosted by our Alumni Executive in the spring. While they could not host the reunion event they had planned on, this group found a way to bring the alumni community together and connect through a shared experience.In this edition of Evergreen, you will read about some of the contributions Greenwood grads have made to solving this wicked problem, from working on the front lines in the ICU to developing potentially life-saving antibodies; you will also learn more about Greenwoods shift to online learning in response to the pandemic. An equally complex, and no less critical, problem we are facing as a society is that of systemic racism. As a school, Greenwood has a responsibility to ensure that we are doing our part to end anti-black racism, and to look critically at our own systems and structures to identify and eliminate bias. In relecting on what we can do to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive school environment, we have identiied several action items that will be addressed during this school year; you can read more about the steps we are taking in the following pages. However, please know that this is only the beginning. We are dedicated to continuing this work in the coming years, and to looking for ways to involve our community in creating real change. It is safe to say that the 2020\\x7f2021 school year will be a year like no other. While there is signiicant work ahead when it comes to these problems,I look forward to working toward solutions with all of you.Sarah BruceOctober 2020Greenwood1GRWD206_Evergreen_2020_v4.indd 1 10/5/20 11:47 PM'", "4": "b'Message From Our Alumni ExecutiveGreenwood Alumni Community,We hope that you and your families are doing well as we continue to adjust to the challenges surrounding the COVID19 pandemic. The 20192020 school year was the Greenwood Alumni Executives irst year as a team. During this irst year, we made signiicant progress towards laying the foundation for a strong alumni community that will be sustainable for generations of graduates to come.We launched the Internship and Mentorship Pairing Program in February 2020, a programaimed at pairing alumni in similar ields together, to foster informal learning environments. We have been successful in completing several matches and the results of these mentoring relationships have already begun to show. Mentors and mentees were introduced to each other via email and had their irst virtual meet-up. We are excited to build on this momentum during the 20202021 school year, as we continue to match mentors and mentees together and look for ways to better support the professional aspirations of the Greenwood community. If you have not already completed the survey to participate in the matching program, we encourage you to reach out to us and get involved!The Events Committee had a fantastic Alumni Reunion planned for May 2020 that would have introduced several new and exciting elements to this annual event. Unfortunately, due to the COVID19 pandemic, the reunion had to be put on hold until we can safely congregate as an alumni communityrest assured that BIG plans are in the making! Luckily, the Events team was able to quickly pivot and they hosted four Instagram Live events featuring: an online concert with The Tales, Max Fulton 16 and Benny Fulton 17; a boxing workout with Sammy Kronick 13; a cooking class with Spencer Newlands 07; and a face mask workshop with Carly McDougald 11. If you missed it, you can re-watch these live events on the Greenwood Alumni Instagram page @greenwood_alumni. Thank you to everyone who participated!We are looking forward to bringing the alumni community together as soon as it is safe to do so. Though COVID19 has created uncertainty surrounding what that may look like, we will continue to brainstorm the best ways to bring the community together.

He graduated from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in Human Evolutionary Biology in 2013, and then went on to complete his Master of Counseling Psychology at OISE, which allowed him to become a Registered Psychotherapist. Daniels interest in counseling began with his role as a Peer Counselor at an organization called Room 13 while he was an undergraduate. Since that time, Ive always been keen on working in mental health, which I think relects how much I enjoy talking to people, said Daniel. There are two primary components of Daniels role as a 2SLGBTQ+ counsellor: he provides ongoing individual therapy to approximately eight clients, and he also facilitates a weekly support group which is meant to be both educational and fun. He and his group have discussions, watch videos, read articles, do art projects and play games. Before the pandemic, all of these activities and meetings would take place in person; today, they are done through video calls or over the phone.Through individual therapy, I am most often helping individuals deal with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns, he said.

In my thesis project, I aim to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of HEARTSMAPU, she said. Following its evaluation, her team intends for HEARTSMAPU to be accessible to postsecondary students across the countryas a downloadable app.Through my experiences at both Colgate and UBC, I have gained more respectand, to my initial surprise, lovefor research, said Heather.

In September, we started our cross-country drive with all our essen-tial belongings in an F150. We drove across Canada to Vancouver Island and did a sea kayaking trip similar to what the Grade 11s do for Fall OE. The best part is, we came practically face to face with a pod of orcas!!We then bought a travel trailer and lived out of it until December. We drove down the entire west coast from Vancouver to San Diego. During that time, we spent a lot of time suring on the ocean and hiking in the Redwood forests. We headed north from San Diego and landed back in Fernie, B.C. En route we hit as many American national parks as possible, including Joshua Tree, Grand Canyon, Zion and Bryce Canyon. We stayed in Fernie for the ski season and had a lot of fun on the slopesit was a wicked powder season! I also did some supply teaching while out in BC and completed an Additional Qualiication course.We went to Costa Rica in early March, planning to stay for six weeks, but only stayed 10 days due to the COVID19 pandemic. So, we went back to Fernie and spent the spring mountain biking, hiking and camping.In June, we drove back home across the country, stopping at Yoho, Ban and Jasper National Parks. It was the best year ever, but I am super thrilled to be back and Im really looking forward to connecting with my students and Advisees this year.

We encourage graduating students and their families to direct their Annual Appeal gifts to their Class Fund. Most funds support student inancial assistance; other areas of support include the Greenwood Centre for Teaching and Learning, the schools area of greatest need and experiential learning programs.Over the years, these funds have supported many current Greenwood students whose inancial situations have changed during their time at the school, allowing them to continue their Greenwood experience. The funds have also supported enhancements to our experiential learning programs, valuable professional development opportunities for our teachers and more. We are very grateful for this generous support from our community and the many opportunities it has made possible for our students and sta\\x01.Our Class Funds are established during students graduating years, but our hope is that our alumni and past parents will help their Class Fund grow in the years to come. This continued support will leave a lasting legacy from each graduating class to the school, and make a real di\\x01erence for students and sta\\x01 in the years to come. For alumni, support for class funds is currently focused on reunion giving (e.g. we will encourage grads to make a donation to their Class Fund in honour of their reunion years).See the chart below for a summary of each Class Fund and what it supports.
