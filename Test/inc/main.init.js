Having assumed the role of Board Chair on July 1, 2022, and not having occasion to be at the school during a regular school day since my children graduated from Greenwood a number of years ago, I thought it was time to see it in action once again. And did I ever!It was a mid-autumn Thursday much like any other. I visited a Grade 7 class that was engaged in a Question of the Day discussion with many eager hands in the air, with full and very lively participation from all students equally. I heard O Canada wafting out of the music room. I looked in on Grade 11 Physics students solving problems on energy conservation, another class working on film projects and a Marketing class working on a plan to expand a business into a new market. Elsewhere and everywhere, students were working independently in quiet spaces, alone and in groups. And then the morning break came along. Suddenly, the halls and stairs were filled with life and positive energy. I carried that positive energy with me for the rest of the day.That was a regular day at Greenwood, post-COVID-19. Over the course of the year we saw the return not just to in-person classroom teaching, but to a renewed slate of outdoor education trips, community outreach, athletics, clubs, theatre productions and all of the other outings and activities that are so much a part of the schools life and culture.Twenty years after the schools founding, I can report that the school community continues to venture further together. It was wonderful to be able to celebrate our Emerald Anniversary with so many past and current members of the Greenwood family over a weekend full of events in October. People reconnected with old friends and made new ones. The gym was packed for an exciting, and dramatic, volleyball game against Lakefield. Students and even staff members performed on stage. People reminisced, as they always do at such events, and they shared the many journeys Greenwoods alumni have taken since graduation. At the same time, everyone shared in the excitement of the athletic, recreational and teaching possibilities that have been opened up by the recent acquisition of the properties on the south-east corner of Mount Pleasant and Balliol.All of these moments were made all the more sweet by our ability to gather together, in person, as a community and as a school. The COVID restrictions on in-person learning took a toll on students, staff and families. Emerging from those restrictions was quite literally like walking outside on a spring day for the first time after a long, hard winter. On behalf of the school community and the Board, I want to express our deepest thanks to the staff, the leadership team and particularly our Principal, Sarah Bruce, for leading the school through the difficult COVID journey.Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 2'", "3": "b'Last year, my predecessor as Board Chair, Don Lewtas, described the launch of our 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, Venture Further Together. It is an ambitious plan being stewarded by Sarah Bruce and the leadership team with five areas of focusmental health and well-being; diversity, equity, and inclusion; experiential learning; smart use of technology; and campus developmenteach with a detailed action plan. The importance of those five areas remains undiminished, as does our commitment to achieving our ambitious goals recognizing we can always do better by deepening our understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing our community. Underpinning the implementation of the action plans and the delivery of daily school activities is an undertaking to provide a safe and welcoming environment for every member of our community to thrive.Greenwood has always been an innovator, and indeed a disruptor, in middle- and high-school education. That could not have been possible without the support of parents and guardians, grandparents and increasingly alumni who have given their time as Board, Roundtable and committee members and volunteers and have provided philanthropic support to make Greenwood what it has become, and will help it move forward to the milestones that lie ahead. To all of you, past, present and future, thank you so much on behalf of the school community.Special thanks this year also go to the Campus Building Committee that was assembled quickly when opportunity knocked, and who moved so effectively to bring the Mount Pleasant and Balliol land purchases to fruition.Finally, to our wonderful staff, leadership team and Sarah Bruce, thank you for your ongoing efforts and working hard to deliver on our mission to challenge, inspire and support each student, within a welcoming community, to develop the knowledge, skills and character needed tolead a fulfilling life and reach their full potential.We can all be optimistic about Greenwoods future, as we collaborate to truly Venture Further Together.Stephen BowmanChair, Greenwood Board of DirectorsGreenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 3'", "4": "b'PRINCIPALS MESSAGE SARAH BRUCEThe 2021-2022 school year was our first under the guidance of Greenwoods new strategic plan, Venture Further Together. We envision Greenwood as a recognized leader in providing an inclusive, customized, engaging and character-building experience that prepares our students to make a positive difference in the world; our five strategic imperatives are designed to move the schooltowards this goal. The first two imperatives listed were identified by our Board of Directors as being top priorities for 2021-2022. Despite the challenges imposed by COVID-19, the school made strides in all five areas, and I am delighted to report on our progress.1 Promote Mental Health and Well-being as Integral Partsof Greenwoods Cultureand ExperienceThe last few years have reaffirmed for us the importance of community, togetherness and belonging for student success and well-being. Progress in this area last year included:Gathering a range of voices to define mental health and well-beingwithin our community: We want to create a holistic view and definition of mental health and well-being that rings true for our community. Last year, we began gathering feedback from students and staff on what mental health means to them, both in the physical world and online.Effectively integrating our full-time Social Worker into the community:Our Social Worker, Shai Kohen, is a key support for students, and we ensured that students were aware of this vital resource. Advisers also leveraged our Social Worker by scheduling classroom visits and referring students for counselling sessions as needed. Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 4'", "5": "b'Assembling a strong team: Our Dean of Students; Director, StudentWell-being; School Nurse; and Social Worker met regularly throughout the year to identify student and staff well-being needs in their areas of focus and to develop approaches to meet those needs. Facilitating a healthy transition to postsecondary: Moving from highschool to university or college is a significant step in students lives, and we want to ensure that they are supported along the way. We offered several information sessions and workshops last year focusing on preparing students for this transition, including a session with Shai Kohen on saying goodbye to your high-school self and a session with an alumnus on networking and interview skills.Hosting family sessions: Connection is critical to well-being, andwe want to ensure that our parents and guardians feel connected to Greenwood. With this in mind, we hosted several Community Conversations for parents and guardians throughout the year introducing different aspects of our school community, offering resources and suggestions and providing an opportunity to ask questions and share ideas. Our Parent Speaker Series also gaveparents and guardians additional resources to support theirchildren at home and to better understand the teen experience. Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 5'", "6": "b'2 Create a Diverse, Equitableand Inclusive CommunityThat Fosters a Sense of BelongingOur approach to bringing greater Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging to Greenwood is focused on creating real, lasting change, and on ensuring that our entire community is moving towards this goal. We recognize that this work is always evolving, and that we must evolve with it; however, a critical part of our ongoing journey towards greater Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging is recognizing the progress we have made and using the knowledge gained through that progress to move forward.Appointing a Director, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Outreach:Rachael Brownell-Swain took on this role at Greenwood starting in September 2021. Throughout last year, Rachael worked with staff to ensure that all staff members have a foundational knowledge and understanding of anti-racist and anti-oppression education; she also began undertaking a systematic examination of Greenwoods structures and systems to ensure that they support Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging.Creating benchmarks to measure progress: Benchmarking is criticalto ensuring that our work is undertaken with purpose. We used the Reimagining Integration: Diverse and Equitable Schools (RIDES) framework as an assessment tool to support and measure deep work in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging, and we will continue to return to these benchmarks in the future.Creating extracurricular opportunities for inclusive communitybuilding: We created several community-building opportunities using an inclusive framework last year. Grade 7 and 8 community outreach centred around rebuilding a community post-COVID, and all grade levels participated in intentional programming based on this objective.Conducting a curriculum audit: Each Subject Team Leader met withRachael last year to initiate a curriculum audit from a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging lens. This work will continue into the 2022-2023 school year.Delivering professional development: Rachael developed a five-phaseprofessional development plan for all staff for the 2021-2022 school year focusing on critical ideas such as avoiding performativity, positive intervention and planning for change. Staff will continue to build upon this strong foundation to create positive and inclusive communitiesat Greenwood.Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 6'", "7": "b'3 Inspire DiscoveryThrough Personalized Experiential LearningIn the years to come, we plan to extend Greenwoods personalized approach further into our experiential learning opportunities. Our work last year focused on laying the groundwork for an expanded experiential learning program by:Developing a rationale, vision and direction for an expandedexperiential learning program: We have begun to examine ideas for both curriculum-connected experiential learning opportunities and opportunities connected to school programs or trips. We will build upon these ideas over the 2022-2023 school year to develop a rationale and vision.Exploring opportunities for virtual field trips: Several virtual field tripswere executed last year connected to courses in Geography, French, Arts and Business. As an example, our Grade 10 Drama class partnered with the Stratford Festival; students viewed two plays online and then attended four virtual workshops where the workshop lead provided ongoing feedback to students. These successful field trips have provided us with a framework for future virtual excursions to locations that would not otherwise be accessible.Investigating and pilotingtechnology to support virtual classroom partnerships: We explored how a telepresence robot could allow students unable to be onsite to have an onsite experience by enabling incidental conversations with peers and teachers. These robots also facilitated experiential school visits. This proof of concept can be built upon in the future to support virtual partnerships with individuals and organizations around the world.Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 7'", "8": "b'4 Continue to Lead in the Smart Use of Technology On and Off Campus to Enable Innovative Learning ApproachesWere committed to continuing to use technology to explore new ideas, spark creativity and promote positive student and staff connections. Progress in this area last year included:Evaluating current resources to determine where enhancementsare needed: Technology must adapt to student and staff needs to be effective. We researched and piloted A/V technology, such as telepresence robots and microphones for classrooms, to enhance hybrid teaching last year. Developing a draft framework/checklist for a modular unit/course: We began to explore leveraging our technology to offer modular digital courses for Greenwood students and potentially for external students. We developed a draft framework for what a digital module could look like and began to determine which subjects and courses would be the best fit for this format.Monitoring and sharing research and best practices: We continued tomonitor the teaching and learning landscape to identify new ideas and best practices that might be integrated into Greenwoods approach. This process linked us with thinkers including Dr. Elka Walsh, the National Learning & Skills Lead for Microsoft Canada, who delivered a session for parents and guardians on the connection between curiosity and deeper learning for teens.Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 8'", "9": "b'5 Develop a Bold Masterplan to Re-Imagine Greenwoods Campus of the FutureSeeking immediate access to green space was one of the two main focuses of this imperative. We made unexpectedly rapid progress last year due to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to purchase a parcel of land south of the school encompassing the KFC and Wolseley Plumbing; we have also purchased four houses on Balliol Street. These properties will yield a lot sized at 63,000 square feet. This land will not only meet our immediate need for green space, but will give us valuable room to think and dreamfor the future.Greenwood plans to develop a multi-purpose recreation space on the site that will meet a wide variety of student needs. The highlight of these new facilities will be an artificial turf playing field that will be converted into an artificial ice rink during the winter months. For Grizzlies athletes, this is a game changer. Teams will now be able to hold practices directly across the street from the school, turning travel time into valuable skill-building time. These facilities will also be available for use by our physical education classes for activities like soccer, flag football, rugby, hockey, ice skating and more.Additionally, our new recreation space will include an outdoor classroom, some multi-use recreation space and washroom facilities. We look forward to students using these spaces throughout the school day as a valuable opportunity to get outside and support their physical and mental health.Our sincere thanks to the Campus Management Committee, chaired by Judy Lewis, for all of their work during the 2021-2022 school year to secure this incredible opportunity for Greenwood.Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 9'", "10": "b'REVENUE AND EXPENSES:GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOLREVENUE BREAKDOWN for the year ended June 30, 202292 %Fees3 %Contributions5 %Other RevenueEXPENSES BREAKDOWN for the year ended June 30, 2022Student Learning and Programming12 % Academic and Co-Curricular Programs61 %Teacher Compensation3 %Information & CommunicationsTechnologySupport2 % Administration & External Relations13 %Staff Compensation9 %FacilitiesGreenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 10'", "11": "b'FUNDRAISING REPORT:GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOL AND GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOL FOUNDATIONThis past year saw our community reintroduce many of the aspects of school life that create a rich and fulsome experience for our students, including athletics, in-person school plays and outdoor education trips. With all students in the building together every day, the most important element was constant, and that was the buzz and laughter in the hallways. We capped off the year with an in-person Celebration Day and Graduation Ceremony for the Class of 2022. This resilient group finished strong and made the absolute most of their final year at Greenwood, providing energy, leadership and school spirit that were felt throughout the entire school.Im pleased to report that our Annual Appeal had another fantastic year. As a community, we raised over $500,000 in Annual Appeal donations and maintained our participation levels. Donations supported diversity, equity and inclusion and health and well-being initiatives, as well as the Greenwood Fund, which supports the schools area of greatest need. Class funds from Grades 7 to 12 also grew significantly thanks to many generous donations. A huge thank you to our parents and guardians, staff members, alumni and past parents for their generosity and support. Greenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 11'", "12": "b'Our alumni community craved a return to campus to see old friends and teachers, and this past May saw our grads come together in numbers we have never seen before. With over 1200 active alumni in our community, over 300 joined us at our Alumni Reunion for food, conversation and live entertainment from The Tales, a band featuring three Greenwood alumni that is making waves in the Toronto music scene.We capped off the year with the amazing announcement that the school has acquired some very strategic property adjacent to the school with the purchase of the KFC franchise land and the Wolseley Plumbing store, in addition to some residential properties just east of these on Balliol Street. This land will have very positive impacts on our community in the short term by enabling the development of a multi-use recreation space featuring a playing field and an ice rink. More news on this exciting project to come!Thanks to the support of our parents/guardians, grandparents, staff, alumni and friends, Greenwood is extremely well positioned to create new and innovative programs and spaces for our students. Greenwood is built on the generosity of its incredible community, and that support has never been more important than it is now.Thank you for doing what you can to support our plans for the future and for making such a profound impact on the lives of our students.Jamie LougheedExecutive Director, AdvancementGreenwood Annual Report 2021/2022 12'", "13": "b'GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOL FOUNDATIONThe foundation is a separately incorporated body that manages and oversees endowment funds established through philanthropic giving to support Greenwood College School.The financial statements for the Foundation as of June 30, 2022, showed total assets of just over $4.68 million.The following funds are held in the Greenwood College School Foundation:THE CLASS OF 2006 FUND THE CLASS OF 2012 FUNDEstablished by a leadership gift fromEstablished through the generosity ofMargot Franssen and Quig Tingley, andthe Class of 2012 families, the Fundthrough the generosity of the Class ofsupports student financial assistance.2006 families, the Fund supports student financial assistance.
